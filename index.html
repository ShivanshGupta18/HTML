                <h1>What is Coronavirus?</h1>
                <p> Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus experience mild to moderate respiratory illness
                    and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical
                    problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more
                    likely to develop serious illness.The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the
                    cause was a then-new coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal
                    and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness in humans. In the past, several infectious disease
                    outbreaks have been traced to viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals that
                    mutated to become dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study may reveal how and why the
                    coronavirus evolved to cause pandemic disease.

                    or taste, nausea, diarrhea.The virus can lead to some fatal diseases like pneumonia, respiratory
                    failure, heart problems, liver
                    problems, septic shock,

                <p>The number of people infected by COVID-19 changes every day.The transmission rate is relatively high.
                    Early research has estimated that one person who has it can spread it to between 2 and 3.5
